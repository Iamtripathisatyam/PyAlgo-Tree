# RSA & El-GAMAL CRYPTOGRAPHY

## Aim

Cryptography is associated with the process of converting ordinary plain text into unintelligible text and vice-versa. It is a method of storing and transmitting data in a particular form so that only those for whom it is intended can read and process it.
A simple algorithm which will convert a plaintext into cipher text and vice-versa using encryption and decryption respectively.

## Purpose

To create a Encryption/Decryption program using RSA & El-Gamal cyptosystems


## Short description of package/script

- The problem is solved using RSA & El-Gamal cyptography
- We use Python to solve this



## Workflow of the Project

When to run the code, a list comes up saying which algorithm you would like to use and proceed accordingly.


## Compilation Steps

After the script is run, enter:

1. Choose what you want to do rsa or el-gamal or quit
2. If the user chooses 1, the user will need to provide 2 prime numbers and a public key(e)The algorithm will then produce a private key
3. It will then ask you to provide a plaintext text. After giving in the value, user will get a cipher text which is encrypted. 
4. Also decryption will be done on the cipher text to produce plain text
