# DIFFIE HELLMANN KEY EXCHANGE ALGORITHM 

## Aim

The Diffieâ€“Hellman (DH) Algorithm is a key-exchange protocol that enables two parties communicating over public channel to establish a mutual secret without it being transmitted over the Internet. 

## Purpose

To create an algorithm of diffie-hellmann key exchange


## Short description of package/script

- The problem is solved using diffie-hellmann key exchange algorithm
- We use Python to solve this



## Workflow of the Project

When to run the code, a list comes up saying which algorithm you would like to use and proceed accordingly.


## Compilation Steps

After the script is run, enter:

1. The user is asked a set of values which the user must give and accordinglt the output is generated.
