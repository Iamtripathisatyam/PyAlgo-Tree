## AIM

To perform various operations of **Linear Algebra** in Python. 

## Purpose

The main aim is to perform various operations on linear algebra in python using numpy module.

## Short Description

* The Python programming language has no built-in support for linear algebra, but it is fairly straightforward to write code which will implement as much as you need. The most obvious way to represent is vectors and matrices.
* SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible .

## Workflow of the project

* Download python from python.org.
* Use any editor like visual studio code, pycharm, etc.
* Use the code and learn the `Linear Algebra` operations performed in Python.
* Also download numpy module by entering - pip install numpy or py -m pip install numpy in terminal.
