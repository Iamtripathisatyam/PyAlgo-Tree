# Array
- An array is a collection of similar type items stored at contiguous memory locations.  This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array. The base value is index 0 and the difference between the two indexes is the offset. 
- In python array is implemented using list data structure.

## Aim
To implement Array data structure in Python.


## Purpose
The purpose is to create an data structure to array and demonstrate the operations.


## Short Description
Array:
- An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together.


## Workflow of the Project
- This script contains seperate files named after the Operation.

* The Array Operations,
    - Operations,
        - append(), 
            - Method used to input element to the end of array.
        - insert(), 
            - Method used to input element in to a specific location of the array.
        - pop(), 
            - Method used to pop element at a particular location of the array. 
        - remove(), 
            - Method used to remove a particular element in an array.
