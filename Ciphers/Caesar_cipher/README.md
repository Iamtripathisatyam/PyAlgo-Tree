### Aim 
To Implement the Ceaser cipher 

### Purpose
- The Ceaser cipher Algorithm is simple to understand and implement.
  This is used to Encrypt the message and Decrypt the message.

### Description

- In cryptography, a Caesar cipher also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. 
  It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

### Workflow
- The complete process depends on length of the alphabets used.
- The letter of an alphabet of size m are first mapped to the integers in the range 0...m-1.
- Each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
- For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is apparently named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his officials. 
- Thus to cipher a given text we need an integer value, known as shift which indicates the number of position each letter of the text has been moved down. 
- The encryption can be represented using modular arithmetic by first transforming the letters into numbers, according to the scheme, A = 0, B = 1,â€¦, Z = 25. Encryption of a letter by a shift n can be described mathematically as. 
 
### Compilation Steps

- Download the file Ceaser_cipher.py
- Run the File Ceaser_cipher.py
- Input any key
- Input the Message 
- And finally we will get Encrypted message and Decrypted Message
