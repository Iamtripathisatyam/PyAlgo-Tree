# **Campus Placement Analysis & Prediction**

**GOAL**

To analyze various factors and predict salary offered to candidates during campus placements using machine learning algorithm.

**DATASET**

Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement).

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- Step 1: Data Preprocessing & Exploration
- Step 2: Data Training & Model Creation
- Step 3: Performance Evaluation

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn (For data traning, importing models and performance check)


**Accuracy of different models used**
 - By using Decision Tree Regressor model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  1.00
 ``` 



**CONCLUSION**

Performance of Decision tree regressor is highyly efficient.
