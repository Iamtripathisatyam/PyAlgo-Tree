## **Movie Classification**

**PURPOSE**

The main prupose is to give a clear understanding on different classification algorithms and their working, usage, libaries used, advantages, disadvantages etc by a project as movie classification.



**WORKING CONDITIONS**
1.  Data preprocessing and exploration to understand what kind of data will we working on.

- Here we work on preprocessing and exploring the data to understand what kind of data we are working on, it's shape, memory usage, columns, data types etc.

2. Data training using train-test-split method from sklearn to split the data into training and testing data and then  Model creation using KNN model, logistic regression model and  decision tree classifier algorithm, where we import the model, then initialize it and fit training data into it and lastly perform predictions on the test data.


3.  Checking performance by error and accuracy check to find how efficient algorithm performed for this project.

**LIBRARIES USED**
- pandas
- sklearn
- numpy

**ADVANTAGES of Classification Algorithms**

- Easy understand & interpret
- Good for classification tasks


**DISADVANTAGES of Classification Algorithms**

- Can give low accuracy if features are not identified properly.
- Cannot be used for regression projects.


**CONCLUSION**

*  For this project i.e. Movies classification we have used KNN Classification algorithm, logistic regression algorithm and decision tree classifier.

- The accuracy of KNN model is 60.40% & the error  is 0.6493.

- The accuracy of Logistic Regression model is 58.66% & the error  is 0.6417.

- The accuracy of Decision Tree Classifier model is 1.00% & the error  is 0.6183.

- Decision Tree classifier has the highest accuracy and least error among other algorithms for this project.

*  It Can help in improving business plan by providing fruitful insights and prediction analysis.
