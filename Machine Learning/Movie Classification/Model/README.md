## **Movie Classification**

**PURPOSE**

The main prupose is to give a clear understanding on what basically KNN Classifier algorithm is all about, its working, usage, libaries used, advantages, disadvantages etc.



**WORKING CONDITIONS**
1.  Data preprocessing and exploration to understand what kind of data will we working on.

- Here we work on preprocessing and exploring the data to understand what kind of data we are working on, it's shape, memory usage, columns, data types etc.

2. Data training using train-test-split method from sklearn to split the data into training and testing data and then  Model creation using decision tree classifier algorithm, where we import the model, then initialize it and fit training data into it and lastly perform predictions on the test data.


5.  Checking performance by error and accuracy check to find how efficient algorithm performed for this project.

- numpy

**ADVANTAGES of KNN Algorithm**

- Easy understand & interpret
- Good for classification tasks


**DISADVANTAGES of KNN Algorithm**

- Can give low accuracy if features are not identified properly.
- Cannot be used for regression projects.


**CONCLUSION**

*  For this project i.e. Movies classification we have used KNN Classification algorithm which is one of the simple and easy classification algorithms.

- The accuracy of KNN model is 60.40%

*  It Can help in improving business plan by providing fruitful insights and prediction analysis.
