# Activity Selection Problem using Greedy Approach
üî¥ Language used : **Python 3**

## üéØ Aim
The aim of this script is to find out the maximum number of activities to be performed by a single person in between the start and finish time given in the problem.

## üëâ Purpose
The main purpose of this script is to show the implementation of Greedy Approach to find out the maximum number of activities to be performed by a single person in between the start and finish time given in the problem.

## üìÑ Description
You are given n activities with their start and finish times. Select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person, assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time. 

Suppose `S = {1, 2....n}` is the set of n proposed activities. The activities share resources which can be used by only one activity at a time, e.g., Tennis Court, Lecture Hall, etc. Each Activity `i` has start time si and a finish time `fi`, where `si ‚â§fi`. If selected activity `i` take place meanwhile the half-open time interval `[si,fi)`. Activities `i` and `j` are compatible if the intervals `(si, fi)` and `[si, fi)` do not overlap (i.e. `i` and `j` are compatible if `si‚â•fi` or `si‚â•fi)`. The activity-selection problem chosen the maximum-size set of mutually consistent activities.

üî¥ Examples: 

```
Constraints:
start[] -> an array of start time for the activities.
finish[] -> an array of finish time for the activities.
output[] -> an array of maximum set of activities to be done by a person.

Input:
Consider the following 6 activities  sorted by finish time.

start[]  =  {1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5};
finish[] =  {2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9};

Output:
A person can perform at most four activities. The maximum set of activities that can be executed is {0, 1, 3, 4} 
[These are indexes in start[] and finish[]]
```

## üìä Flowchart
```
printMaxActivities(s, f)
1. n ‚Üê length [s]
2. A ‚Üê {1}
3. j ‚Üê 1.
4. for i ‚Üê 2 to n
5. do if si ‚â• fi
6. then A ‚Üê A ‚à™ {i}
7. j ‚Üê i
8. return A
```

## üßÆ Algorithm
- This algorithm is called Greedy-Iterative-Activity-Selector, because it is first of all a greedy algorithm, and then it is iterative. There's also a recursive version of this greedy algorithm.
- Sorts in increasing order of finish times the array of activities `A` by using the finish times stored in the array `f`. This operation can be done in `O(n log n)` time, using for example merge sort, heap sort, or quick sort algorithms.
- Creates a set `S` to store the selected activities, and initialises it with the activity that has the earliest finish time.
- Creates a variable `k` that keeps track of the index of the last selected activity.
- Starts iterating from the second element of that array `A` up to its last element.
- If the start time `s[i]` of the `ith` activity `A[i]` is greater or equal to the finish time `f[k]` of the last selected activity `A[k]`, then `A[i]` is compatible to the selected activities in the set `S`, and thus it can be added to `S`.
- The index of the last selected activity is updated to the just added activity `A[i]`.
