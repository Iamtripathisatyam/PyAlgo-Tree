# 0-1 Knapsack Problem using Dynamic Method
Language used : Python 3

## üìÉ Approach 
In the Dynamic programming we will work considering the same cases as mentioned in the recursive approach. In a `DP[][]` table let‚Äôs consider all the possible weights from ‚Äò1‚Äô to ‚ÄòW‚Äô as the columns and weights that can be kept as the rows. 

The state `DP[i][j]` will denote maximum value of ‚Äòj-weight‚Äô considering all values from ‚Äò1 to ith‚Äô. So if we consider `‚Äòwi‚Äô` (weight in ‚Äòith‚Äô row) we can fill it in all columns which have ‚Äòweight values > wi‚Äô. Now two possibilities can take place: 

- Fill `‚Äòwi‚Äô` in the given column.
- Do not fill ‚Äòwi‚Äô in the given column.

Now we have to take a maximum of these two possibilities, formally if we do not fill `‚Äòith‚Äô` weight in `‚Äòjth‚Äô`column then `DP[i][j]` state will be same as `DP[i-1][j]` but if we fill the weight, `DP[i][j]` will be equal to the value of `‚Äòwi‚Äô+` value of the column weighing `‚Äòj-wi‚Äô` in the previous row. So we take the maximum of these two possibilities to fill the current state.

## üßÆ Algorithm
Let's visualize the algorithm here,

```
Let weight elements = {1, 2, 3}
Let weight values = {10, 15, 40}
Capacity=6

0   1   2   3   4   5   6

0  0   0   0   0   0   0   0

1  0  10  10  10  10  10  10

2  0  10  15  25  25  25  25

3  0
 
Explanation:
For filling 'weight = 2' we come 
across 'j = 3' in which 
we take maximum of 
(10, 15 + DP[1][3-2]) = 25   
  |        |
'2'       '2 filled'
not filled  

0   1   2   3   4   5   6

0  0   0   0   0   0   0   0

1  0  10  10  10  10  10  10

2  0  10  15  25  25  25  25

3  0  10  15  40  50  55  65

Explanation:
For filling 'weight=3', 
we come across 'j=4' in which 
we take maximum of (25, 40 + DP[2][4-3]) 
= 50

For filling 'weight=3' 
we come across 'j=5' in which 
we take maximum of (25, 40 + DP[2][5-3])
= 55

For filling 'weight=3' 
we come across 'j=6' in which 
we take maximum of (25, 40 + DP[2][6-3])
= 65
```

## ‚è∞ Complexity Analysis: 
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N*W)`. [where ‚ÄòN‚Äô is the number of weight element and ‚ÄòW‚Äô is capacity. As for every weight element we traverse through all weight capacities 1<=w<=W.]
- **Auxiliary Space :** `O(N*W)`. [The use of 2-D array of size `‚ÄòN*W‚Äô`.]
