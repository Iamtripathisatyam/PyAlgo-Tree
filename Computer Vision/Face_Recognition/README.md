# Face-Recognition-System
- Face recognition is a method of identifying or verifying the identity of an individual using their face. Face recognition systems can be used to identify people in photos, video, or in real-time.
- Face recognition systems use computer algorithms to pick out specific, distinctive details about a person’s face. These details, such as distance between the eyes or shape of the chin, are then converted into a mathematical representation and compared to data on other faces collected in a face recognition database.


## Aim
To develop a Face Recognition System using openCV and record the Name and Time of the person's apperance in front of the camera.


## Purpose
The purpose is to Build A Real-Time Face Recognition End-To-End Project.


## Short Description
- This project is done with this fantastic “Open Source Computer Vision Library”, the OpenCV.
- OpenCV
        - OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on     real-time applications. So, it’s perfect for real-time face recognition using a camera.

## Workflow of the Project
* There are 4 phases in this project.
    - Face Detection and Data Gathering
    - Train the Recognizer
    - Face Recognition 
    - Record Name and Time in an external CSV file.

* The Array Operations,
    - Operations,
        - append(), 
            - Method used to input element to the end of array.
        - insert(), 
            - Method used to input element in to a specific location of the array.
        - pop(), 
            - Method used to pop element at a particular location of the array. 

        - remove(), 
            - Method used to remove a particular element in an array. 
         
 ## Output:
Test case 1:
- Lets create an array of size 3

- Operation 1 printing the array created

- Operation 2 Adding Integer element to array using append  
    - We are adding 4 to array
<img src="../Array Operations/Images/Output1_part3.png">

- Operation 3 Adding Integer element to array using insert
    - We are adding 5 to index 2 of array 
<img src="../Array Operations/Images/Output1_part4.png">

- Operation 4 removing Integer element from array using pop
    - We are removing the element at index 2
<img src="../Array Operations/Images/Output1_part5.png">

- Operation 5 removing Integer element from array using remove
    - We are removing the element 2
<img src="../Array Operations/Images/Output1_part6.png">

- Operation 6 exit
